				I learned how to program in 2015 while taking an introductory programming class in college.
				I learned how to write <span class="text-white font-medium">VB.NET</span> and
				<span class="text-white font-medium">C++</span>, while also learning how to create GUI's
				with the help of <span class="text-white font-medium">Visual Studio</span>.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				From there, I dabbled in game development with <span class="text-white font-medium"
					>Unity</span
				>
				and <span class="text-white font-medium">C#</span>. Ultimately I wasn't very interested in
				game development and decided to pivot towards building for the
				<span class="text-white font-medium">web</span>. I went the
				<span class="text-white font-medium">self taught</span>
				route and learned everything I could about web technologies. After mastering
				<span class="text-white font-medium">JavaScript</span>,
				<span class="text-white font-medium">HTML</span>, and <span class="text-white">CSS</span> I
				was immediately drawn to the <span class="text-white font-medium">React</span> ecosystem and
				found my passion in web development. After building tons of projects and confidence in my
				skills as a developer, I landed my first
				<span class="text-white font-medium">Full Stack Development</span> job in 2020.
			</p>

			<br />
			<p>
				These days I find myself using <span class="text-white font-medium">SvelteKit</span> and
				<span class="text-white font-meidum">Next.js </span>as Full Stack frameworks,
				<span class="text-white font-medium">TypeScript</span>
				and <span class="text-white font-medium">Tailwind </span>for the frontend and
				<span class="text-white font-medium">Node.js</span>
				or <span class="text-white font-medium">C#</span> for backends. As for databases, I prefer
				to use <span class="text-white font-medium">PostgreSQL</span> or
				<span class="text-white font-medium">MongoDB</span>.
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>
				In my free time you can catch me either hanging out with family and friends, watching
				movies, playing video games, or working out at the gym. If you're lucky you might catch me
				in a Primeagen twitch chat.
